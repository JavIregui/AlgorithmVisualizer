# Algorithm Visualizer

**Algorithm Visualizer** is a long-term Python project aimed at practicing the implementation of different algorithms, visualizing them, and learning about their efficiency.

More algorithms will be gradually added over time.

## Features

- Algorithm selection menu
- Several algorithms can be run at the same time
- You can:
  - Time each algorithm
  - Change the number of items in the set
  - Read an explanation of the algorithm

## Included Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Cocktail Shaker Sort
  - Tim Sort
  - Gnome Sort
- Search Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Jump Search
  - Exponential Search
  - Interpolation Search
  - Ternary Search
  - Fibonacci Search
- Graph Algorithms:
  - Dijkstra
  - A*
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Backtracking Algorithms:
  - N Queen Problem
  - Sudoku Solver
  - Knight's Tour
- Maze Generation Algorithms:
  - Recursive Backtracking
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
- Evolutionary Algorithms:
  - Genetic Algorithm
- Geometric Algorithms:
  - Convex Hull (Graham's Algorithm)

## Future Features

At the moment, there are no plans to introduce any new features other than new algorithms.

## Requirements

**Python** must be installed on your machine to run the project. In the future, I may create a .exe and a .dmg so you can run it without needing Python.
